# Shipping-cost-calculator

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: 
This is a simple C++ shipping cost calculator program. The program takes in package dimensions from the user as inputs and calculates the total shipping cost of it.
The dimensions of the package should not exceed a certain limit or else the package cannot be shipped and there is a percentage of tax if the dimensions exceed a certain measurement.

WHAT I HAVE LEARNT: 
  - Declaring variables of data type 'double'.
  - Using if and else statements.
  - Using nested if statements.
  - Using else if statements.
